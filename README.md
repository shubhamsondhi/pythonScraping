# pythonScraping

## Introduction
Get all the data about rented rooms on Kijiji.

I love kijiji rental ads database and I  wants these ads to visualize on map.So, I create the scraping tool which will take the url from the kijij ``(for now:  You need to go to the page and select the location and catagory )`` and will give me the visual representation of the retal rooms. Even better, if I ever have to see the price of selling home around me this tool will do for me. It is my personal tool. Although the day after I started this idea many similar tools came in the market which do the same thing but these tools are still not as good as this because of low ads and low frequecy of ads compare to kijij.

This project was generated with Python and Angular.
