# pythonScraping

## Introduction
Get all the data about rented rooms on Kijiji.

I love kijiji rental ads database and I  wants these ads to visualize on map. So, I created the scraping tool which will take the url from the kijij ``(for now:  I need to go to the page and select the location and catagory )`` and will give me the visual representation of the rental rooms. Even better, if I ever have to see the price of rented homes around me this tool is best. It is my personal tool. Although the day after I started this idea, many similar tools came in the market which are doing the same thing but these tools are still not as good as this because of low quantity and frequency of rented rooms advertisments compare to kijij.

This project was generated with Python and Angular.
